# Overview

This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in creating interactive and visually appealing mapping applications while incorporating real-world data to enhance the user experience.

The map software allows users to explore and visualize various landmarks in a specified area (Miami, FL). Users can click on individual landmarks to view detailed information, including the address and category of each point of interest. The map is rendered with custom symbols based on different categories, such as schools, churches, and parks, making it easy to distinguish between various types of landmarks.

The data used in this project is sourced from an ArcGIS Feature Layer hosted on [ArcGIS Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/). The Feature Layer contains information about different landmarks, including their names, addresses, and categories. This data enriches the map and provides users with valuable insights into the diverse points of interest in the specified location.

The primary purpose of developing this software is to showcase my ability to integrate geospatial data into a web-based application using the ArcGIS JavaScript API. By creating a user-friendly interface and incorporating interactive features, I aim to demonstrate the practical application of mapping technologies in providing valuable information to end-users.

# Development Environment

The development of this software involved using the following tools and technologies:

- **ArcGIS JavaScript API:** The core API for creating interactive maps and leveraging geospatial data.
- **HTML and CSS:** Used for structuring the web page and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for implementing the map functionality and interaction.
- **ArcGIS Hub:** The specific dataset used for this project is hosted on [ArcGIS Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/MiamiGIS::landmarks).

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites proved to be valuable resources:

- [ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/): Official documentation and guides for the ArcGIS JavaScript API.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): Mozilla Developer Network for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS references.

# Future Work

To enhance and further refine the map software, the following areas could be addressed in future iterations:

- Implementing additional features for user interactivity, such as search functionality.
- Enhancing the user interface and overall design for improved aesthetics and user experience.
- Exploring additional data sources to expand the diversity of landmarks displayed on the map.
- Conducting performance optimizations for smoother rendering and interaction on various devices.
